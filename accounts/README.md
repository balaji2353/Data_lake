This folder contains account-scoped Terraform environments.

- `TAX_AWS_NPD` — Development account (dev environments copied here).
- `in-TAX-AWS-PRD` — Production account (prod environments copied here).

Files under each account are copies of the original service `environments/*` directories to help migrate to account-scoped layout. Review and, once verified, consider removing or archiving the original top-level environment folders.
